# An Efficient Framework for Detecting Face Region Based on Skin Color Modeling and SVM Classifier
Detection of face from a face image is very crucial for fully automated face recognition system for intelligent vision system for the purpose of security and human robot interaction. In this regard, a framework has been proposed in this paper for detection of face region from face images. For detection of face region, color and shape characteristics of face region is utilized. Based on these ideas initially, HSV and YCbCr color models are used to eliminate the illumination sensitiveness for segmentation. In the second step, statistical threshold value is used for color segmentation. Next, labeling and filtering is used to extract the shape. Finally, by using SFTA (Segmentationâ€“based Fractal Texture Analysis) method, texture feature of face region is extracted and fed to SVM to verify the face region. Various face images are used with variety of conditions to test the proposed framework and results are presented to prove the efficiency
